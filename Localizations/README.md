# Localizations #

This folder is intended as export location for Xcode's *"Export for Localizationsâ€¦"* feature.

## XLIFF ##

If you want to add a localization to KeepingYouAwake, please use these XLIFF files as reference, e.g. `de.xliff`. You can then import them in Xcode.

XLIFF files should be committed with any new translation and will be kept up-to-date during development.
