# Version 1.3: Scripting and Custom Icons Update

- Basic command line interface through URI schemes
	- *Thank you [KyleKing](https://github.com/KyleKing) for the suggestion!*
	- you can activate/deactivate the sleep timer with unlimited time intervals
	- you can open *KeepingYouAwake* from the command line with a custom sleep timer duration
	- the *seconds*, *minutes* and *hours* parameters are rounded up to the nearest integer number and cannot be combined at the moment

```
open keepingyouawake://  
open keepingyouawake:///activate    # indefinite duration  
open keepingyouawake:///activate?seconds=5  
open keepingyouawake:///activate?minutes=5  
open keepingyouawake:///activate?hours=5  
open keepingyouawake:///deactivate
```

- Support for custom menu bar icons. Just place four images named `ActiveIcon.png`, `ActiveIcon@2x.png`, `InactiveIcon.png`, `InactiveIcon@2x.png` in your `~/Library/Application Support/KeepingYouAwake/` folder. The recommended size for these images is 22x20 points
- hold down the option key and click inside the *"Activate for Duration"* menu to set the default duration for the menu bar icon
