# Version 1.2.1: AC Power Update

- Fixed an issue where "Start at Login" would crash when clicked multiple times in a row *(Fixed by [registered99][1], thank you!)*
- Less aggressive awake handling when the MacBook lid is closed by using the `caffeinate -di` command instead of `caffeinate -disu`
- You can revert back to the previous behaviour by pasting the following snippet into *Terminal.app*:
	- `defaults write info.marcel-dierkes.KeepingYouAwake.PreventSleepOnACPower -bool YES`
- `ctrl` + `click` will now display the menu
