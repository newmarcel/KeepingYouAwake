# Version 1.4.0beta1: Preferences Beta

- Added a preferences window that replaces seldom used menu items and surfaces advanced and experimental preferences
- You can now set the default activation duration for the menu bar icon in preferences
- Removed the advanced preference for `info.marcel-dierkes.KeepingYouAwake.PreventSleepOnACPower`
- Added an advanced preference to allow display sleep while still preventing system sleep ([Issue #25][1])
- Ability to set a battery level on MacBooks where the app will deactivate itself ([Issue #24][2])
