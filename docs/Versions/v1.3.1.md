# Version 1.3.1: Updater and Icon Fixes

- Fixed Sparkle Updates *(Broken thanks to App Transport Security in OS X 10.11 and GitHub disabling HTTPS for pages)* **If you know someone with Version 1.3.0, please let them know that 1.3.1 is available and can be downloaded manually to receive future updates.** This is a nightmare come trueâ€¦ ðŸ˜±
- Fixed rendering for custom icons: They are now rendered as template images
- Added advanced settings to disable the blue highlight rectangle on click. Enable it with *(replace YES with NO to disable it again)*:
	- `defaults write info.marcel-dierkes.KeepingYouAwake info.marcel-dierkes.KeepingYouAwake.MenuBarIconHighlightDisabled -bool YES`
